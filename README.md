### Hi, I'm VinÃ­cius ðŸ‘‹

I've been working with hybrid mobile development since 2019, primarily with React Native. Appreciate the peace of mind that comes with well-tested, documented code. Strive to automate everything I do - from sending out builds to running tests. Self-taught and fast learner. I have already developed and participated in the development of applications that impact hundreds of people every day.

Get in touch :)
